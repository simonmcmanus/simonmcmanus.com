What with the launch of the official Osmosoft.com site linking to my blog I thought it would be appropriate to give you an idea of what I hope to do in BT Osmosoft. As a part of BT we will have a focus on using the BT SDK ([http://sdk.bt.com/](http://sdk.bt.com/ "http://sdk.bt.com/")) which provides the following services :  

  
*   SMS
  
*   Voice Calls
  
*   Conference Calls
  
*   Authentication
  
*   Information about Me
  
*   Location
  
*   Contacts
  

  
here are my current ideas of how I would like to use them :  
  
**WordPress Plug-in - [http://wordpress.com/](http://wordpress.com/ "http://wordpress.com/")**  
  
WordPress is a popular open source blogging application. I would like to create a plug-in for WordPress which integrates some of the functionality mentioned above. The most obvious use would be a widget with a "text me" or "Ring Me" button allowing readers to get in contact with the blog owner on their mobile without exposing the mobile number.  
  
**Facebook Application - [http://www.facebook.com/](http://www.facebook.com/ "http://www.facebook.com/")**  
  
I like Facebook, its very addictive. Ive been particularly keeping an eye on the application that resulted from its API.  
  
([http://developers.facebook.com/](http://developers.facebook.com/ "http://developers.facebook.com/")) One of the things which I find interesting about facebook applications is their ability to spread very very quickly....

So what kind of functionality would I be looking to integrate into Facebook? Below are some initial ideas.....  
  
1 .. Allow users to store their contact details and provide a "call me" and "text me" buttons on facebook.  
  
2 .. Use the BT SDK Location service to display a users location  
  
3 .. Integration with BT Vault - let users share files using BT Vault on facebook.  
  
4 .. Import/Export of BT contacts One Address book and Facebook contacts?  
  
5 .. Some kind of Yellow Pages (YELL.COM) integration?  
  
6 .. Interface into MSN, Yahoo, AOL and google chat all from within facebook.  
  
I will post updates and new ideas on this blog so please keep checking back.
