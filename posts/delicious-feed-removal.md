Following on from my previous posts about [the Robbie problem](http://simonmcmanus.com/2007/11/28/the-robbie-clutton-problem/ "the Robbie problem") I have now removed my mystical link between my blog and del.icio.us account.  
  
If anyone would like to follow my del.icio.us links feed then you can get it [here.](http://del.icio.us/simonmcmanus "here")
