One of the big motivations behind [EnhanceConf](http://enhanceconf.com)  was education. Conferences are a great place to learn but the associated costs often make them difficult for many to attend. In the spirit of progressive enhancement, we want to make EnhanceConf available to the widest possible audience.  
  
We have allocated a number of scholarship tickets for people who would like to attend but cannot pay for a ticket.  

### How to Apply
  
Send a short email to info@enhanceconf.com with a title of EnhanceConf Scholarship.  
  
**In your email please include:**  
  
- Who are you?  
- What do you do?  
- Why would you like the scholarship?  

### Who should apply:

  
The scholarships are available to anyone not normally able to attend a conference. If that might be you (even if you're not in one of the groups below) then please apply.  
  
Some of the groups we are especially keen to support include:  

  
*   Ethnic minorities 
*   Women
*   LGBTQIA+
*   Disabled people
*   Charity workers
*   Education / students
*   Open source projects
*   Industry newcomers
  
If you have any questions, just send an email to info@enhanceconf.com  
  
**Details: **  
  
All emails will be treated in the strictest confidence, we will not announce who the scholarships go to but you’re welcome to say so yourself.  
  
Successful applicants will get a standard conference ticket.  
  
We are only able to cover the cost of the conference ticket so please consider your travel costs before applying.
