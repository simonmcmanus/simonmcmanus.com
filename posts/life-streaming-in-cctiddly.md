This afternoon I noticed [Phil Hawksworth](http://www.hawksworx.com/journal/ "http://www.hawksworx.com/journal/") playing around with a script to add a life streaming to his blog.  
  
Thanks to [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/ "http://adactio.com/"), for the [original code](http://adactio.com/extras/stream/stream.phps "http://adactio.com/extras/stream/stream.phps")  
  
With very few changes I have got the script working in [ccTiddly](http://cctiddly.sourceforge.net/).  
In index.php you simply need to add the code contained in this file ([lifestream1.txt)](https://simonmcmanus.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/lifestream1.txt "lifestream1.txt") under  
  
<div id="storeArea">  
  
in Index.php  
  
And below is the end result.

This code probably wont make it into the next release of ccTiddly but I thought I would get it out there for you to play with.  
  
Some of the date sorting bits are not actually required here because Tiddlywiki can do the date sorting.  
  
Enjoy, comments and suggestions welcome as always.
