I'm currently at the second day of the [LeWeb3 Conference](http://www.leweb3.com/ "le web 3"). For a long time I have disliked the term "web 2.0" for a number of reasons.  
  
It has no clear definition, different people take it to mean completely different things.  
  
The web is evolving, it is not released in easily defined iterations.  
  
[Doc Searls](http://doc-weblogs.com/ "Doc Searls") asked the question in his talk: who can define web 2.0? About 2 people in an audience of 1000 people raised their hands.  
  
Often these terms are used to describe things that we don't quite understand or can't explain. I once overhead [Tom Morris](http://tommorris.org/ "Tom Morris") say that its only non-developers who use the term web 2.0.  
  
Its scary how many time I have heard people say they want a web 2.0 app. [This post](http://blogs.smh.com.au/innovator/archives/2007/09/has_innovation_become_a_dirty.html "This ost") talks about how innovation has become a dirty word. I think the same can be said for anything ending 2.0.  
  
I would love to see an end to terminology 2.0 but realistically I can only ask that if people insist on using these terms they follow it by an explanation of what they actually mean.
