title: Open Source Facebook?

So approximately 15 hours after the issue was acknowledged it was then fixed with in two hours. one of the good reasons for going open source is that you're not waiting for a corporation to admit they have a bug in their software.  
  
This leaves me with the question - what would happen if Facebook were open sourced?  
  
Lets be in no doubt that Facebook is a great concept, but one that can and will be replicated. so what would happen? Well i am no expert but I do like to speculate. Even with their source code in the public, Facebook still have their domain and data as massive assets.  
  
I am opening a big can of worms here, one that I could talk about all day long. I will try to come back to this topic over the coming weeks.
