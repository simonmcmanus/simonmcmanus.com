title: A Simple CKEditor Plugin Template
tags: ["osmososft","post"]
---
FCKEditor has recently released a new version called [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/). Unfortunately much of the documentation has not been updated which makes building things on top of the API somewhat difficult at the moment.  
  
I have published a basic template which make it clear how to create a plugin that adds an item to the CKEditor toolbar, when that button is pressed the users is presented with a simple dialog box containing two tabs which can interact with the parent editor.  
  
The template can be found at :
