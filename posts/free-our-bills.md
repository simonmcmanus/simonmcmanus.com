For those of you that have not already seen [http://www.theyworkforyou.com/](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) please go and check it out now. Its been around for a good few years now but I was particularly pleased to see their recent action list ([Free our Bills](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/)) has gained support from David Cameron. Im sure this will make lots of the "Give us our data back" folk happy.

In relation to [Emma Mulqueenys](http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/) point about [Links, libel and law](http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2008/03/19/links-libel-and-law/). My linking to Mr Cameron does not in anyway suggest support for his views except in the Free our Bills case. I am simply linking to an article which I have read/watched and found sufficiently interesting to share with others.
