title: Pondering PageRank and TinyURLs

A couple of weeks ago I posted a link on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "twitter") and noticed it was automatically converted into a tinyurl ([http://tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com "http://tinyurl.com")). The URL was not too long to fit into my 140 characters.  
  
This got me thinking, I have never felt the need to use tinyurls, but are they actually doing damage?  
  
How do tinyurls effect PageRank? Should hosts fear a duplicate content penalty? especially if tinyurl.com has a higher initial page rank than your own site?  
  
Has anyone seen googles algorithm deal with these URLs in a good or bad way? Are all these great links in twitter going to waste? Surely not?  
  
There is some debate about this topic here :

I would be interested in any views on this.
