        "summary": "\nStephan Lavavej has a great page outlining the difference between fancy interlacing and plain old progressive rendering:\n\nThere are four ways to transmit an image over the Internet. Over a fast connection there won't be any apparent difference, but over a modem connection the difference is stunningly obvious. Choosing the right way can make your connection seem much faster than it really is.\nWait until every bit of image data has been sucked through the modem before displaying the whole image. So blindingly dumb that not even Internet Explorer does it.\nDisplay image data as it is received, resulting in a top-down filling in of the image. One variant -- the one that everyone has seen -- of JPEG does this. This is noninterlaced display, and both GIF and PNG are capable of it as well. Non-interlaced images are smaller than interlaced images.\nUse a one-dimensional interlacing scheme. This is how GIF interlacing works. Every eighth horizontal line is transmitted in the first \"pass\", filling up the dimensions of the image in 1/8th of the time that the entire image will take to download. The next pass transmits every fourth line, making the image less distorted. The next pass transmits every second line, making the image even less distorted, and the fourth and final pass transmits the remaining lines.\nUse a two-dimensional interlacing scheme. This is how PNG interlacing works. Instead of four passes through the image, PNG makes seven passes. In 1/64 of the time that the whole image will take to display, one pass is already completed, showing the image in a very rough manner. Successive passes fill in more information, never distorting the pixels by more than a factor of two to one.\nHere's a demo of simple progressive as-received rendering:\n\n\nAnd here's a demo of the superior PNG style two-dimensional interlaced rendering:\n\n\nYou don't get this for free, of course -- turning this feature on adds about 20% to the size of PNG images, and about 10% to the size of JPEG and GIF images. Whether this improved rendering behavior is worth the bandwidth cost I leave as an exercise to the reader.\n\nI am not aware of any browsers that actually bilinearly interpolate the low-resolution incremental images, as shown in the sample screenshots on Stefan's page. But that would be really cool! Why doesn't Firefox add this?\n\nNEXT\nThis Just In: Internet Makes Books Obsolete\n\nPREVIOUS\nUI Follies, Volume III\n\nWritten by Jeff Atwood\nIndoor enthusiast.

I figured out how to get nightwatch+selenium-standalone+chromedriver+chrome working somehow, without fully understanding each part in the puzzle. I went with Nightwatch because I like the syntax and it seems one of the obvious options nowadays. That works until I updated some dependencies and broke everything again. So I took some time to figure out how these things fit together and what is really needed for me tests. I’ve learned that Selenium is the godmother of modern frontend testing. It’s a framework with bindings for multiple languages. To decouple the server from the actual browsers, it invented “Selenium RC” as a protocol. That lead to the development of the WebDriver W3C standard which replaces Selenium RC is newer versions and is implemented for the most common browsers (Chrome -> Chromedriver, Firefox -> FirefoxDriver).",

Although most often used for position-encoding quantitative data, such as mapping a measurement in meters to a position in pixels for dots in a scatterplot, scales can represent virtually any visual encoding, such as diverging colors, stroke widths, or symbol size. Scales can also be used with virtually any type of data, such as named categorical data or discrete data that requires sensible breaks.\n\nFor continuous quantitative data, you typically want a linear scale. (For time series data, a time scale.) If the distribution calls for it, consider transforming data using a power or log scale. A quantize scale may aid differentiation by rounding continuous data to a fixed set of discrete values; similarly, a quantile scale computes quantiles from a sample population, and a threshold scale allows you to specify arbitrary breaks in continuous data.\n\nFor discrete ordinal (ordered) or categorical (unordered) data, an ordinal scale specifies an explicit mapping from a set of data values to a corresponding set of visual attributes (such as colors). The related band and point scales are useful for position-encoding ordinal data, such as bars in a bar chart or dots in an categorical scatterplot.\n\n",

Sarah Drasner has shown some good examples and even a Vue library to boot.These animations are the type of features that can turn a good user experience into a great one. But to achieve this in a React stack, it is necessary to couple crucial parts in your application: the routing logic and the animation tooling.Let’s start with animations. We’ll be building with React, and there are great options out there for us to leverage. Notably, the react-transition-group is the official package that handles elements entering and leaving the DOM. Let’s explore some relatively straightforward patterns we can apply, even to existing components.",

You can do all of this by implementing dynamic image transformation and delivery URLs. You can change the required transformations at any time. All transformed images are created on-demand (lazily) and delivered to your users through a fast CDN with optimized caching.For example, you can resize and crop images, deliver them using the image format that fits your needs, and/or apply a variety of filters and effects. You can also use our smart cropping techniques, including face-detection or auto-gravity for cropping based on the most relevant parts of uploaded photos. For complex transformations, you can use the Management Console or Admin API for defining named transformations and even run a set of chained transformations on your images. You can also use the Management Console to view delivery usage reports and optimization insights.This page teaches you how Cloudinary transformations work and provides detailed descriptions and use‑case examples for commonly-used transformations.",

Loughton Brook, which comes off the forest and runs under the High Road and alongside Roding Road, also used to over-spill its banks regularly.

That’s because by default, browsers will load external CSS synchronously—halting all page rendering while the CSS is downloaded and parsed—both of which incur potential delays. Of course, at least a portion of a site’s CSS should be loaded before the page should be allowed to start rendering, and to get that initial CSS to the browser immediately, we recommend inlining (or HTTP2 server-pushing) the CSS. For sites with a small amount of overall, that alone might be enough, but if the CSS is large (say, bigger than 15 to 20kb), it can help performance to split it up by priority. Once split, less-critical CSS should be loaded in the background—AKA asynchronously. In this post, I aim to describe up our preferred way to do that these days, which has actually been around for years.",

VEs are often done with the labouring woman lying on her back, but it is possible to do a VE in any position, which may be preferable as lying down in labour, even for a short time, can be very uncomfortable. It is important to know that while VEs are offered to almost every woman, and they are often seen as an essential part of labour, there is actually a lot of evidence to support women considering not having them at all - this will be discussed below.",

There are several different types of Vitamin K and these different types all have different effects on the body. The only effect that is being considered when Vitamin K is offered to your baby is its role in reducing the chance of complications from excessive bleeding known as Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB). VKDB was previously known as Haemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) and the two names refer to the same condition. VKDB is very rare but it can be very serious, which is why the parents of all babies in the UK are offered an injection of Vitamin K for their baby, just after birth, even though almost all of those babies will not benefit from it. If parents decline the injection they should be offered an oral dose given several times over a few weeks.",
